    "- Portfolio Part 4, being an open-ended task, meant I could choose the dataset I wanted. I therefore chose a dataset which extracted features from different song samples and classified them into different genres. There were pros and cons of choosing the particular [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/insiyeah/musicfeatures?select=data.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pros: Data included labels which could be encoded using ordinal encoder or one-hot encoder. There were 29 features in total, and no null values so no cleaning was necessary. There were equal number of samples for each genre, so the prediction model would be fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cons: The dataset was very small i.e. 100 songs per genre and 10 genres so 1000 data samples in total. For creation of a fair model, the dataset should be vast. Furthermore, of the 29 features, majority were useless for a layman to understand and hence had to be dropped from the dataset.\n",
