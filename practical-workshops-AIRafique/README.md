This repository contains practical notebooks of **Student ID: 48065145** for COMP2200/COMP6200 for Session S2-2023 @ Macquarie University

This repository contains my practical notebooks for COMP2200/COMP6200 Session S2, 2023. The initial repository had one notebook for the first week. Each week I will add a new notebook and commit my changes as I complete the problems set for me. At the end of the semester I will have this repository as a record of my work. This can then form part of my ongoing portfolio of work.

I have updated this README file to personalise my repository.
