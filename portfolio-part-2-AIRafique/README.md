# Analysis of an E-Commerce Dataset part 2

## About

`Student ID: **48065145**` 

This repository contains the project for portfolio part 2. 

It builds upon the portfolio part 1, where we analyzed a dataset and cleaned it by removing null values and any outliers. We use the cleaned dataset to create linear regression models using highly correlated and non-correlated features, as well as different proportions of training and testing data and then compare the accuracy of each of the models.
