This repository contains the project for portfolio part 4. 

The portfolio task involved gathering data for a real life use case, and a dataset of Music Features seemed perfect for this. The major question being "Is it possible to accurately predict the genre of a song based on quantitative features"?
The project includes data preparation, analysis, and training of different models using correlated features.
